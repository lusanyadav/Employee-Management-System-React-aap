Role-Based Functionality: Built a task management system where Admins can assign tasks, and Employees can accept, reject, or complete them.

Admin Dashboard: Allows Admins to monitor each employee's task status and track how many tasks have been completed.

Employee Dashboard: Enables Employees to view assigned tasks and take appropriate actions.

React Context API: Used for managing global state across components efficiently.

Conditional Rendering: Implemented to differentiate views and actions for Admin and Employee roles.

Local Data Persistence: Utilized localStorage to store user sessions and task data across browser refreshes.

Clean UI/UX: Designed with simplicity and clarity to ensure easy navigation for both Admins and Employees.

No Backend Required: Fully functional without a backend, ideal for frontend architecture demonstration.
